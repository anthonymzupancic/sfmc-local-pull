# SFMC Local File Pull

## What is this?
This is an in progress script that pulls assets from Salesforce Marketing Cloud Content Builder and writes them locally to dedicated files.

This script can be run with a category ID (folder ID) to narrow the scope or without.

At the moment, the script does not paginate/pull _all_ assets or place them in any sort of foldering structure but may be included at some point!
